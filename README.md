# apt-rpm2

Since apt-rpm hasn't been maintained actively in over 4 years, we will be maintaining the apt-rpm codebase here. In order to prevent confusion, we refer to it as the 2nd Generation apt-rpm, or also known as apt-rpm2.

Since we did a (nearly) direct import from the original apt-rpm Git repository, the commits and contributors have remained intact so a lot of historical information has been preserved.

Enjoy!
